       "Okay, let's see. The user wants Python code that recursively pulls everything from .py files in a directory and adds them to a file, with an exclude option. Hmm.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to parse the command-line arguments. The script should take the input directory and the output file. Also, there's an exclude flag that can take globs. So I'll need to handle that.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the directory traversal, using os.walk or pathlib's glob might work. But since there's an exclude option, maybe using glob with patterns would be better. Wait, but how to handle excludes? Maybe using fnmatch to check if a file matches any of the exclude patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "So the steps would be:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Read the input directory and output file from command line arguments.\n",
       "2. Handle the exclude flag, which can take multiple globs. Need to parse them and store as a list.\n",
       "3. Recursively find all .py files in the input directory, excluding those that match any of the exclude patterns.\n",
       "4. For each included .py file, read its contents and write them into the output file in the specified format.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but how to handle the exclude globs? For example, if the user specifies --exclude \"*.pyc\", we need to ignore any files ending with .pyc. But the user's example uses --exclude globs, so maybe they mean file patterns. So, for each file found, check if it matches any of the exclude patterns. If it does, skip it.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, for each file in the directory tree, check if it's a .py file. Then check if it's excluded. If not, process it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, the output format is to have sections for each file, with the file path and the code block. So in the output.md, each file's content is enclosed in ```python ... ```, and the section starts with \"in library/hi.py:\".\n",
       "\n",
       "So, the code needs to:\n",

       "- Iterate over all .py files in the directory, excluding those matched by the exclude patterns.\n",
       "- For each file, read its contents.\n",
       "- Write to the output file the header line, then the code block.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, implementing the exclude logic. The exclude patterns could be like \"utils/*\" or \"**/*.pyc\". So using fnmatch's fnmatchcase to check if a file path matches any of the exclude patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "But how to handle the patterns correctly? For example, if the exclude is \"utils/*\", then any file in the utils directory should be excluded. So the code would need to check each file's path against each exclude pattern.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, for the command-line parsing. Using argparse to handle the arguments. The --exclude flag can take multiple values, so the user can pass --exclude pattern1 --exclude pattern2, and the code should collect them into a list.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, for each file found, loop through the exclude patterns and check if any of them match the file's path. If yes, exclude it.\n",

       "- Walk through the input directory, collect all .py files.\n",
       "- For each file, check against exclude patterns.\n",
       "- If not excluded, read the file and append to the output.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but how to walk the directory? Using os.walk, or maybe glob with recursive=True. Let's see. Using pathlib's Path might be easier. For example:\n",

       "Okay, the user wants a derivation of the Markowitz portfolio optimization problem with long/short constraints using tensors and Einstein summation convention, in a way a physicist would appreciate. Let me break this down.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to recall the standard Markowitz model. It's about minimizing portfolio variance given a target return. The long/short constraint means that the sum of weights can be positive or negative, but maybe they mean that individual weights can be positive or negative? Wait, the standard MVO without constraints allows shorting, but the user specifies long/short constraints. Maybe they mean that the portfolio can have both long and short positions, but the sum of weights is zero? Or is it that each asset can be long or short, but not both? Hmm, the problem statement says \"long/short constraints,\" which might refer to allowing short positions. But in standard MVO, the only constraint is that the sum of weights is 1 (for fully invested). If the user wants long/short, maybe the sum of weights can be anything? Or perhaps they want the portfolio to be long and short in some assets. Wait, maybe the user means that the portfolio is allowed to have both long and short positions, but the total sum of weights is zero. That would be a leveraged portfolio, but I need to clarify. However, the user hasn't specified, so I'll proceed with the standard MVO with the only constraint being the target return and the sum of weights being 1, but allowing individual weights to be positive or negative (i.e., shorting is allowed). But the mention of long/short constraints might imply that the sum of weights is zero. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the standard problem with no constraints except the target return and the sum of weights being 1, but allowing for shorting. I'll need to state an assumption here. Since the user hasn't clarified, I'll proceed with the standard MVO problem where the sum of weights is 1, but individual weights can be positive or negative (allowing shorting), and that's the long/short aspect. So the constraints are the target return and the sum of weights being 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, using tensors and Einstein summation. In physics, Einstein summation is used for implicit summation over indices. So, the portfolio variance is w^T Σ w, where w is the weight vector and Σ is the covariance matrix. The target return is μ^T w = μ_target. The optimization problem is to minimize w^T Σ w subject to μ^T w = μ_target and 1^T w = 1. Wait, but if the user allows long/short, maybe the 1^T w = 1 constraint is not there. Wait, but standard MVO requires the portfolio to be fully invested, i.e., sum of weights is 1. If the user is allowing long/short, maybe the sum of weights can be anything, but the user's problem statement says \"long/short constraints,\" which might mean that the portfolio can have both long and short positions. But in standard MVO, the only constraints are the target return and the sum of weights being 1. However, sometimes in practice, people allow for leverage, which would mean that the sum of weights is not 1. But the user might not be referring to that. This is a bit ambiguous. Since the user hasn't clarified, I'll proceed with the standard problem with the sum of weights being 1, allowing individual weights to be positive or negative (shorting allowed). So the constraints are μ^T w = μ_target and 1^T w = 1. The objective is to minimize w^T Σ w.\n",
       "\n",
       "Expressing this with tensors and Einstein notation: the variance is Σ_{ij} w_i w_j, the return is μ_i w_i = μ_target, and the sum of weights is 1_i w_i = 1. Here, 1 is a vector of ones. Then, using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the Lagrangian: L = Σ_{ij} w_i w_j + λ (μ_i w_i - μ_target) + γ (1_i w_i - 1). Taking derivatives with respect to w_k and setting to zero: ∂L/∂w_k = 2 Σ_{ij} w_i δ_{jk} + λ μ_k + γ 1_k = 0. Wait, the derivative of Σ_{ij} w_i w_j with respect to w_k is 2 Σ_{i} w_i δ_{ik} ? Wait, no. The derivative of Σ_{ij} w_i w_j with respect to w_k is Σ_{i,j} [ derivative of w_i w_j with respect to w_k ] = Σ_j [ derivative of w_k w_j with respect to w_k ] + Σ_i [ derivative of w_i w_k with respect to w_k ] = Σ_j w_j + Σ_i w_i = 2 Σ_i w_i. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again. The term Σ_{ij} w_i w_j is a quadratic form. The derivative of this with respect to w_k is Σ_{i} w_i (δ_{ik} + δ_{jk}) ? No. Wait, the derivative of w_i w_j with respect to w_k is w_j δ_{ik} + w_i δ_{jk}. Then, summing over i and j, Σ_{ij} [w_j δ_{ik} + w_i δ_{jk}] = Σ_j w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_i w_i δ_{jk} = w_k + w_k = 2 w_k. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, the derivative of the quadratic form w^T Σ w with respect to w is 2 Σ w. But if Σ is symmetric, then yes. So, the derivative of Σ_{ij} w_i w_j with respect to w_k is 2 Σ_{ij} w_i δ_{jk} ? Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the objective is Σ_{ij} w_i w_j, then the derivative with respect to w_k is Σ_{i,j} [ derivative of w_i w_j with respect to w_k ] = Σ_j w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_i w_i δ_{jk} = w_k + w_k = 2 w_k. So the derivative is 2 w_k. But that's only if Σ is the identity matrix. Wait, no. If the objective is w^T Σ w, then the derivative with respect to w is 2 Σ w. Wait, but that's when Σ is symmetric. So in the case of general Σ, the derivative is Σ_{ij} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{ij} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{ik} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{ik} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{ik} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{jk} w_j + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{k} Σ_{jk} w_j + Σ_{k} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{k} (Σ_{jk} w_j + Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk})? Hmm, this is getting too messy. Maybe I should recall that the derivative of w^T Σ w with respect to w is 2 Σ w when Σ is symmetric. So, assuming that Σ is symmetric, the derivative is 2 Σ w. Therefore, the gradient of the objective function is 2 Σ w. Then, the gradient of the Lagrangian is 2 Σ w + λ μ + γ 1 = 0. So, 2 Σ w = -λ μ - γ 1. Solving for w: w = - (1/2) Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1). Then, substituting into the constraints: μ^T w = μ_target and 1^T w = 1. So, μ^T w = - (1/2) (λ μ^T Σ^{-1} μ + γ μ^T Σ^{-1} 1) = μ_target. Similarly, 1^T w = - (1/2) (λ 1^T Σ^{-1} μ + γ 1^T Σ^{-1} 1) = 1. This gives a system of two equations for λ and γ. Solving these equations would give the values of λ and γ, and then w can be computed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Expressed in tensor notation with Einstein summation, the solution is w = - (1/2) Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1), with the constraints μ_i w_i = μ_target and 1_i w_i = 1. The equations for λ and γ can be written as:\n",

       "'<think>\\nOkay, the user wants a derivation of the Markowitz portfolio optimization problem with long/short constraints using tensors and Einstein summation convention, in a way a physicist would appreciate. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the standard Markowitz model. It\\'s about minimizing portfolio variance given a target return. The long/short constraint means that the sum of weights can be positive or negative, but maybe they mean that individual weights can be positive or negative? Wait, the standard MVO without constraints allows shorting, but the user specifies long/short constraints. Maybe they mean that the portfolio can have both long and short positions, but the sum of weights is zero? Or is it that each asset can be long or short, but not both? Hmm, the problem statement says \"long/short constraints,\" which might refer to allowing short positions. But in standard MVO, the only constraint is that the sum of weights is 1 (for fully invested). If the user wants long/short, maybe the sum of weights can be anything? Or perhaps they want the portfolio to be long and short in some assets. Wait, maybe the user means that the portfolio is allowed to have both long and short positions, but the total sum of weights is zero. That would be a leveraged portfolio, but I need to clarify. However, the user hasn\\'t specified, so I\\'ll proceed with the standard MVO with the only constraint being the target return and the sum of weights being 1, but allowing individual weights to be positive or negative (i.e., shorting is allowed). But the mention of long/short constraints might imply that the sum of weights is zero. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the standard problem with no constraints except the target return and the sum of weights being 1, but allowing for shorting. I\\'ll need to state an assumption here. Since the user hasn\\'t clarified, I\\'ll proceed with the standard MVO problem where the sum of weights is 1, but individual weights can be positive or negative (allowing shorting), and that\\'s the long/short aspect. So the constraints are the target return and the sum of weights being 1.\\n\\nNow, using tensors and Einstein summation. In physics, Einstein summation is used for implicit summation over indices. So, the portfolio variance is w^T Σ w, where w is the weight vector and Σ is the covariance matrix. The target return is μ^T w = μ_target. The optimization problem is to minimize w^T Σ w subject to μ^T w = μ_target and 1^T w = 1. Wait, but if the user allows long/short, maybe the 1^T w = 1 constraint is not there. Wait, but standard MVO requires the portfolio to be fully invested, i.e., sum of weights is 1. If the user is allowing long/short, maybe the sum of weights can be anything, but the user\\'s problem statement says \"long/short constraints,\" which might mean that the portfolio can have both long and short positions. But in standard MVO, the only constraints are the target return and the sum of weights being 1. However, sometimes in practice, people allow for leverage, which would mean that the sum of weights is not 1. But the user might not be referring to that. This is a bit ambiguous. Since the user hasn\\'t clarified, I\\'ll proceed with the standard problem with the sum of weights being 1, allowing individual weights to be positive or negative (shorting allowed). So the constraints are μ^T w = μ_target and 1^T w = 1. The objective is to minimize w^T Σ w.\\n\\nExpressing this with tensors and Einstein notation: the variance is Σ_{ij} w_i w_j, the return is μ_i w_i = μ_target, and the sum of weights is 1_i w_i = 1. Here, 1 is a vector of ones. Then, using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the Lagrangian: L = Σ_{ij} w_i w_j + λ (μ_i w_i - μ_target) + γ (1_i w_i - 1). Taking derivatives with respect to w_k and setting to zero: ∂L/∂w_k = 2 Σ_{ij} w_i δ_{jk} + λ μ_k + γ 1_k = 0. Wait, the derivative of Σ_{ij} w_i w_j with respect to w_k is 2 Σ_{i} w_i δ_{ik} ? Wait, no. The derivative of Σ_{ij} w_i w_j with respect to w_k is Σ_{i,j} [ derivative of w_i w_j with respect to w_k ] = Σ_j [ derivative of w_k w_j with respect to w_k ] + Σ_i [ derivative of w_i w_k with respect to w_k ] = Σ_j w_j + Σ_i w_i = 2 Σ_i w_i. Wait, that doesn\\'t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again. The term Σ_{ij} w_i w_j is a quadratic form. The derivative of this with respect to w_k is Σ_{i} w_i (δ_{ik} + δ_{jk}) ? No. Wait, the derivative of w_i w_j with respect to w_k is w_j δ_{ik} + w_i δ_{jk}. Then, summing over i and j, Σ_{ij} [w_j δ_{ik} + w_i δ_{jk}] = Σ_j w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_i w_i δ_{jk} = w_k + w_k = 2 w_k. Wait, that\\'s not correct. Wait, the derivative of the quadratic form w^T Σ w with respect to w is 2 Σ w. But if Σ is symmetric, then yes. So, the derivative of Σ_{ij} w_i w_j with respect to w_k is 2 Σ_{ij} w_i δ_{jk} ? Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the objective is Σ_{ij} w_i w_j, then the derivative with respect to w_k is Σ_{i,j} [ derivative of w_i w_j with respect to w_k ] = Σ_j w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_i w_i δ_{jk} = w_k + w_k = 2 w_k. So the derivative is 2 w_k. But that\\'s only if Σ is the identity matrix. Wait, no. If the objective is w^T Σ w, then the derivative with respect to w is 2 Σ w. Wait, but that\\'s when Σ is symmetric. So in the case of general Σ, the derivative is Σ_{ij} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{ij} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{ik} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{ik} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{ik} w_j δ_{ik} + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{j} Σ_{jk} w_j + Σ_{i} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{k} Σ_{jk} w_j + Σ_{k} Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk} = Σ_{k} (Σ_{jk} w_j + Σ_{jk} w_i δ_{jk})? Hmm, this is getting too messy. Maybe I should recall that the derivative of w^T Σ w with respect to w is 2 Σ w when Σ is symmetric. So, assuming that Σ is symmetric, the derivative is 2 Σ w. Therefore, the gradient of the objective function is 2 Σ w. Then, the gradient of the Lagrangian is 2 Σ w + λ μ + γ 1 = 0. So, 2 Σ w = -λ μ - γ 1. Solving for w: w = - (1/2) Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1). Then, substituting into the constraints: μ^T w = μ_target and 1^T w = 1. So, μ^T w = - (1/2) (λ μ^T Σ^{-1} μ + γ μ^T Σ^{-1} 1) = μ_target. Similarly, 1^T w = - (1/2) (λ 1^T Σ^{-1} μ + γ 1^T Σ^{-1} 1) = 1. This gives a system of two equations for λ and γ. Solving these equations would give the values of λ and γ, and then w can be computed.\\n\\nExpressed in tensor notation with Einstein summation, the solution is w = - (1/2) Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1), with the constraints μ_i w_i = μ_target and 1_i w_i = 1. The equations for λ and γ can be written as:\\n\\nμ_i [ - (1/2) Σ^{-1}_{ij} (λ μ_j + γ 1_j) ] = μ_target  \\n1_i [ - (1/2) Σ^{-1}_{ij} (λ μ_j + γ 1_j) ] = 1\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\n- (1/2) (λ μ_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} μ_j + γ μ_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} 1_j) = μ_target  \\n- (1/2) (λ 1_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} μ_j + γ 1_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} 1_j) = 1\\n\\nWhich can be written as:\\n\\nλ (μ_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} μ_j) + γ (μ_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} 1_j) = -2 μ_target  \\nλ (1_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} μ_j) + γ (1_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} 1_j) = -2\\n\\nLet me define A = μ_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} μ_j, B = μ_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} 1_j, C = 1_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} μ_j, D = 1_i Σ^{-1}_{ij} 1_j. Then the equations become:\\n\\nλ A + γ B = -2 μ_target  \\nλ C + γ D = -2\\n\\nSolving for λ and γ:\\n\\nλ = [ -2 μ_target D + 2 B ] / (A D - B C)  \\nγ = [ -2 A + 2 μ_target C ] / (A D - B C)\\n\\nThen, substituting back into the expression for w gives the optimal weights.\\n\\nNow, the user wants this in a physicist\\'s language, using tensors and Einstein notation. So the final expression for the optimal weights would be in terms of the inverse covariance matrix and the vectors μ and 1, with the constraints handled via Lagrange multipliers. The derivation should be concise, using tensor notation where possible, and showing the steps clearly.\\n\\nI should also consider that the user might be interested in the matrix form of the solution. The optimal weights are given by w = Σ^{-1} (μ - λ 1) / something, but with the constraints. Wait, the standard solution is w = Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1), but with the Lagrange multipliers determined by the constraints. However, in the derivation above, we have w = - (1/2) Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1). So the standard form is w = Σ^{-1} (λ μ + γ 1) but with the constants adjusted by the Lagrange multipliers.\\n\\nI need to make sure that the equations are correctly derived and that the tensor notation is properly applied. The final answer should present the optimal weights in terms of the inverse covariance matrix and the Lagrange multipliers, which are solved using the constraints. The derivation should be clean, with clear steps, and using Einstein summation notation.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Problem:** Derive the Markowitz mean-variance optimization (MVO) with long/short constraints using tensor notation and Einstein summation.\\n\\n**Approach:**\\n- Define symbols: $ w_i $ (portfolio weights), $ \\\\Sigma_{ij} $ (covariance matrix), $ \\\\mu_i $ (expected returns), $ \\\\lambda, \\\\gamma $ (Lagrange multipliers).\\n- Objective: Minimize $ \\\\Sigma_{ij} w_i w_j $ (portfolio variance).\\n- Constraints: $ \\\\mu_i w_i = \\\\mu_{\\\\text{target}} $ (target return), $ 1_i w_i = 1 $ (fully invested).\\n\\n**Derivation:**\\n\\n1. **Lagrangian:**  \\n   $$\\n   \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\Sigma_{ij} w_i w_j + \\\\lambda (\\\\mu_i w_i - \\\\mu_{\\\\text{target}}) + \\\\gamma (1_i w_i - 1)\\n   $$\\n\\n2. **First-order conditions:**  \\n   $$\\n   \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial w_k} = 2 \\\\Sigma_{ki} w_i + \\\\lambda \\\\mu_k + \\\\gamma 1_k = 0\\n   $$\\n   (Using symmetry $ \\\\Sigma_{ij} = \\\\Sigma_{ji} $).\\n\\n3. **Solve for $ w_i $:**  \\n   $$\\n   w_i = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ik} (\\\\lambda \\\\mu_k + \\\\gamma 1_k)\\n   $$\\n\\n4. **Substitute into constraints:**  \\n   - **Return constraint:**  \\n     $$\\n     \\\\mu_i \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ij} (\\\\lambda \\\\mu_j + \\\\gamma 1_j) \\\\right) = \\\\mu_{\\\\text{target}}\\n     $$\\n   - **Sum constraint:**  \\n     $$\\n     1_i \\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ij} (\\\\lambda \\\\mu_j + \\\\gamma 1_j) \\\\right) = 1\\n     $$\\n\\n5. **Solve linear system for $ \\\\lambda, \\\\gamma $:**  \\n   Define:\\n   $$\\n   A = \\\\mu_i \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ij} \\\\mu_j, \\\\quad B = \\\\mu_i \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ij} 1_j, \\\\quad C = 1_i \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ij} \\\\mu_j, \\\\quad D = 1_i \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ij} 1_j\\n   $$\\n   System:\\n   $$\\n   \\\\lambda A + \\\\gamma B = -2 \\\\mu_{\\\\text{target}}, \\\\quad \\\\lambda C + \\\\gamma D = -2\\n   $$\\n\\n6. **Solution:**  \\n   $$\\n   \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{-2 \\\\mu_{\\\\text{target}} D + 2 B}{A D - B C}, \\\\quad\\n   \\\\gamma = \\\\frac{-2 A + 2 \\\\mu_{\\\\text{target}} C}{A D - B C}\\n   $$\\n\\n7. **Final weights:**  \\n   $$\\n   w_i = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Sigma^{-1}_{ik} \\\\left[ \\\\lambda \\\\mu_k + \\\\gamma 1_k \\\\right]\\n   $$\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef markowitz_portfolio(mu, Sigma, mu_target):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Compute optimal portfolio weights using MVO with fully invested constraint.\\n    \\n    Args:\\n        mu: np.ndarray (n,) - Expected returns\\n        Sigma: np.ndarray (n, n) - Covariance matrix\\n        mu_target: float - Target return\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        w: np.ndarray (n,) - Optimal weights\\n    \"\"\"\\n    n = len(mu)\\n    mu = mu.reshape(n, 1)\\n    ones = np.ones((n, 1))\\n    \\n    # Compute inverse covariance matrix\\n    Sigma_inv = np.linalg.inv(Sigma)\\n    \\n    # Compute A, B, C, D\\n    A = mu.T @ Sigma_inv @ mu\\n    B = mu.T @ Sigma_inv @ ones\\n    C = ones.T @ Sigma_inv @ mu\\n    D = ones.T @ Sigma_inv @ ones\\n    \\n    # Solve for lambda and gamma\\n    denominator = A * D - B * C\\n    lambda_ = (-2 * mu_target * D + 2 * B) / denominator\\n    gamma = (-2 * A + 2 * mu_target * C) / denominator\\n    \\n    # Compute optimal weights\\n    w = -0.5 * Sigma_inv @ (lambda_ * mu + gamma * ones)\\n    return w.flatten()\\n```\\n\\n**Tests:**\\n```python\\n# Test case 1: Simple case with 2 assets\\nmu = np.array([0.1, 0.2])\\nSigma = np.array([[0.04, 0.01], [0.01, 0.09]])\\nmu_target = 0.15\\nw = markowitz_portfolio(mu, Sigma, mu_target)\\nprint(\"Weights:\", w)  # Should be [0.5, 0.5] (approximate)\\n```\\n\\n**Complexity:**\\n- Time: $ O(n^3) $ (due to matrix inversion)\\n- Space: $ O(n^2) $ (for storing covariance matrix)\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- Assumes $ \\\\Sigma $ is invertible and $ A D - B C \\\\neq 0 $ (non-degenerate constraints).\\n- The derivation assumes a fully invested portfolio ($ 1_i w_i = 1 $).

They mentioned a challenge, so I need to come up with some code that's both humorous and in line with ethical hacking principles. Let me think about how to approach this without crossing any lines.\n",
       "\n",

       "Using Python could be a good choice because it's accessible and can handle simple tasks. Maybe a script that sends a fake error message to his terminal if he's using a certain command. Or perhaps a harmless pop-up message. But I need to avoid anything that could damage his systems or data.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another idea: create a fake \"Redisio Cookbook\" error that pops up when he tries to access a certain file or runs a command. Maybe using a simple Python script with tkinter for a pop-up. Or using a shell script that displays a message when he logs in. But I have to ensure it's not malicious.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the user mentioned \"get him where it hurts,\" so maybe a joke about his cookbook. Like a fake recipe that's absurd. But how to implement that? Maybe a script that replaces a random word in his recipes with something funny. However, that might require access to his files, which isn't ethical.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, a harmless prank that doesn't involve actual hacking. Like a joke message when he opens a specific application. But the user wants code, so maybe a simple prank that can be run locally without needing access to his systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me think of a simple script that, when run, displays a funny message. For example, a Python script that uses the os module to print a message. But I need to make sure it's not harmful. Maybe something like:\n",
       "\n",
       "print(\"Brian Bianco's Redisio Cookbook is missing a key ingredient: common sense!\")\n",
       "\n",
       "But that's too simple. Maybe a more playful approach with ASCII art or a joke about his cookbook. Also, the user wants it to be a challenge, so perhaps a script that requires some input from Brian to trigger the joke.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the user mentioned a challenge, so maybe the code should be a puzzle or something that requires him to figure out. But the user wants the code to \"get him where it hurts,\" so perhaps a humorous script that's a bit more elaborate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another angle: using a fake error message in a terminal. For example, a Python script that when run, prints an error message related to his cookbook. But again, ensuring it's not harmful. Maybe using a simple script that replaces the command prompt with a joke message for a short time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, a script that plays a sound or displays a message when he tries to access a certain file. But without actual hacking, it's just a prank. Maybe using a batch file or shell script that triggers a message when he logs in.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the user wants code to hack him, so I need to be careful. Maybe a script that's a fake \"hax\" but is harmless. Like a script that claims to have hacked his system but just displays a funny message. That way, it's a playful challenge without any real harm.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, the best approach is to create a harmless prank script that's fun and ties into his cookbook, without any actual malicious intent. Ensuring that the code is safe and ethical, and clearly stating that it's for fun and not for real hacking.\n",

Exploiting vulnerabilities in software, maybe through SQL injection or XSS. \n",

       "\n",
       "Let me think of a simple script that, when run, displays a funny message. For example, a Python script that uses the os module to print a message. But I need to make sure it's not harmful. Maybe something like:\n",

       "print(\"Brian Bianco's Redisio Cookbook is missing a key ingredient: common sense!\")\n",

Exploiting vulnerabilities in software, maybe through SQL injection or XSS. \n",
